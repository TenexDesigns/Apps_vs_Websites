Icons -Yes, there are a number of icon libraries that you can use in Jetpack Compose. Here are a few examples:

Material Icons: This is the default icon library for Jetpack Compose. It provides a wide range of icons that are designed to match the Material Design aesthetic.
Material Icons Extended: This library provides a set of extended Material Design icons that are not included in the default Material Icons library.
Font Awesome: This library provides a large collection of icons, including many popular brands and social media icons.
Ionicons: This library provides a set of icons that are designed for mobile apps.
Octicons: This library provides a set of icons that are designed for GitHub and other open source projects.


You can also use any custom icon that you create yourself. To do this, you can convert your icon to a vector image and then add it to your project's resources directory.

To use an icon in Jetpack Compose, you can use the Icon composable. This composable takes the name of the icon as a parameter, and it will display the icon on the screen.

For example, to display the Material Icons Menu icon, you would use the following code:

import androidx.compose.material.Icon

@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Icon(Icons.Filled.Menu)
}
You can also use the Icon composable to display custom icons. To do this, you need to pass the painter parameter to the Icon composable. The painter parameter is a drawable that represents the icon.

For example, to display a custom icon that is stored in the resources directory, you would use the following code:

import androidx.compose.ui.res.painterResource

@Composable
fun MyComposable() {
    Icon(painterResource(R.drawable.my_icon))
}
I hope this helps!

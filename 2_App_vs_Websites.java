The usage and popularity of apps versus websites depend on various factors, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer to which is used more or reaches more people. Both apps and websites have their own strengths and weaknesses, and their effectiveness depends on the specific use case and target audience. Here are some considerations:

**Websites:**

1. **Accessibility:** Websites are accessible on a wide range of devices with internet browsers. They are platform-agnostic, meaning they can be accessed from any device with a web browser, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and even smart TVs.

2. **Search Engine Visibility:** Websites are easily discoverable through search engines like Google. Proper SEO (Search Engine Optimization) can help drive organic traffic to a website.

3. **No Installation Required:** Users don't need to install anything to access a website. They can simply visit the website through their browser, which can lead to a lower barrier to entry.

4. **Content-Centric:** Websites are excellent for content-driven applications, informational sites, blogs, and e-commerce platforms.

**Apps:**

1. **Performance and Functionality:** Native apps can offer superior performance and access to device-specific functionality (e.g., camera, GPS, push notifications) compared to web apps.

2. **Offline Access:** Some apps can work offline, which is beneficial for tasks that require data collection or content consumption without an internet connection.

3. **Engagement:** Apps can provide a more immersive and personalized user experience, leading to higher user engagement. They can also send push notifications to re-engage users.

4. **Monetization:** Apps offer various monetization options, such as in-app purchases, subscriptions, and advertising, which can be lucrative for developers.

5. **Platform-Specific:** Apps are typically platform-specific (iOS, Android, Windows), which can require additional development effort and cost to target multiple platforms.

6. **Installation Requirement:** Users need to download and install apps, which can be a barrier to entry. App discovery can also be challenging in crowded app stores.

In terms of reaching a broader audience, websites generally have an advantage because they are more accessible across different platforms and devices without the need for installation. Websites are also discoverable through search engines, which can drive organic traffic.

However, for specific use cases that require high performance, offline access, or advanced device integration, native apps can provide a better user experience and may be preferred.

Ultimately, the choice between a website and an app should be based on your specific goals, target audience, and the functionality you require. Many businesses and organizations choose to have both a website and a mobile app to cater to a wider range of users and use cases.

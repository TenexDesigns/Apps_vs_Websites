Apps are used more than websites, and are likely to reach more people and actually be used by more people.

According to a 2023 report by eMarketer, **people spend 88% of their mobile time using apps, and only 12% browsing websites**. This trend is expected to continue, as apps become more sophisticated and offer a better user experience than websites.

There are several reasons why apps are more popular than websites:

* Apps are designed specifically for mobile devices, so they are faster and more responsive than websites.
* Apps can take advantage of hardware features such as GPS, cameras, and accelerometers, which websites cannot.
* Apps can offer push notifications, which can keep users engaged even when they are not actively using the app.
* Apps can be downloaded from app stores, which makes them easy to find and install.

Of course, there are some cases where websites are still more popular than apps, such as for news and information websites. However, for most tasks, apps are the preferred choice for mobile users.

Here are some examples of tasks that are more likely to be done on apps than on websites:

* Checking social media
* Playing games
* Shopping online
* Using navigation apps
* Banking and financial transactions
* Ordering food and other services

If you are looking to reach a large audience with your product or service, it is important to consider developing a mobile app. Apps are more likely to be seen and used by people than websites, and they offer a number of advantages over websites, such as push notifications and access to hardware features.

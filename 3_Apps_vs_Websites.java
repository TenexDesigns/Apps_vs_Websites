Both apps and websites have their own advantages and are used in different contexts. Here's a comparison between apps and websites in terms of usage and reach:

1. Usage:
   - Apps: Mobile apps are designed to provide a more focused and tailored experience for specific tasks or functionalities. They are typically downloaded and installed on a user's device, allowing for offline access and utilizing device-specific features. Apps can offer more interactive and immersive experiences, making them suitable for tasks like gaming, productivity, social networking, and more.
   - Websites: Websites are accessed through web browsers and provide a more general and accessible experience. They are designed to be viewed on various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Websites are commonly used for informational purposes, e-commerce, content publishing, and online services.

2. Reach:
   - Apps: Mobile apps are distributed through app stores (such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store), which provide a centralized platform for users to discover and download apps. While app stores have a large user base, the competition is high, and getting users to discover and install your app can be challenging. However, once installed, apps can have higher user engagement and retention rates.
   - Websites: Websites are accessible through URLs and can be easily discovered through search engines, social media, and other online channels. Websites have a broader reach as they can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and a web browser. They are more discoverable and can attract a larger audience, especially if they are optimized for search engines and have a strong online presence.

In terms of which is used more and likely to reach more people, websites generally have a wider reach due to their accessibility and discoverability. However, the popularity and usage of mobile apps have been increasing rapidly, especially with the widespread adoption of smartphones. The choice between an app and a website depends on the specific goals, target audience, and functionality of your project.

It's worth noting that some businesses and organizations choose to have both a website and a mobile app to cater to different user preferences and provide a seamless experience across platforms.
